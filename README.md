### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Luis Rossi (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I'm currently working as a Developer at IEEE Computer Society - GuaratinguetÃ¡, SP (Brazil),  while I'm an engeneering student at UNESP - FEG.

I'm passionate about problemsolving and helping people using my Dev skills. On account of the fact that challenges make me grow so much, I'm always looking for good projects and challenges in order to develop my abilities as a developer.

Would you like to know more about me? Here is my Linkedin:
